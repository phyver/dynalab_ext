Language
========

The code (variable names, comments, etc.) must be written in English.

User messages, etc. should be in English.
Use gettext to translate them to French or some other language.

I don't know how to localize the inx files! Write them in English (folder
menu-en) during developpment and translate them to menu-<LANG>/<EXTENSION>.inx
when it works.


Python
======

Try to conform to the PEP 8 style guide.

That includes:

  - using 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
  - only ASCII identifiers
  - all files UTF-8 encoded

Lines up to 120 caracters long are OK.

I automatically format my code using "black" (https://github.com/psf/black)
with "--line-length=120" and sort imports using "isort"
(https://github.com/pycqa/isort/).
