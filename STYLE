Language
========

The code (variable names, comments, etc.) must be written in English.

User messages, etc. should be in English.
Use gettext to translate them to French or some other language.

I don't know how to localize the inx files! Write them in English during
developpment and translate them to <EXTENSION>_fr.inx when it works.


Python
======

Try to conform to the PEP 8 style guide.

That includes:

  - using 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
  - only ASCII identifiers
  - all files UTF-8 encoded

Lines up to 120 caracters long are OK.
