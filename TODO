GENERAL
=======

  - refactor diagnostics
      - mark non vectorized visual elements
      - mark tiny visual elements
      - mark visual elements outside page
      - mark open subpaths
      - mark groups, layers and symbols
      - mark elements with effects

  - using external inkscape command to get bounding boxes of nested groups
    only returns the outermost one!
    => use --query-all when initializing a dynalab extension?

  - deal with symbols

  - clean up outline_bb, outline_arrow and outline_text methods

  - abort extensions if they take too long???

  - make all diagnostic (except path) only apply to paths?
    with extra argument --only-paths=false available in expert mode?

  - artefact should be given an id that only depends on the id of the
    referenced object, so that we can "merge" artefacts to the same object
    into a single one.
      => OK for bounding boxes
      => do the same for arrows / text outlines

  - translate to French

  - write documentation in .md files so that we can point to the git repo
    somewhere

  - config option to avoid calls to external inkscape command
    (get_inkscape_bboxes)

  - config options for OK / WARNING / ERROR colors

  - config options for savedir and filename (for exporting)

  - all tagged element could receive a new description ("<desc>") for easy
    selection in inkscape (Ctrl-f)
      => it should be removed when cleaning artefacts
      => ideally, it should keep existing descriptions (prefix those messages
      with a special prefix???)

  - automatic tests => look at the way official extensions are tested using
    pytest

  - add an option "make this language the default" in expert -> config
    it should
      - remove menus
      - copy menus-LANG to menus
      - rename <name>Dynalab - LANG</name> to <name>Dynalab</name>
      - remove the "make this language the default" entry


EXTENSIONS
==========

easy
----

  - display palette of colors as small squares just outside the page
  - check stroke colors for allowed modes

not easy
--------

  - isolated elements ???
  - strict duplicate elements (NOTE: the objects could be groups containing many elements)

to discuss
----------

  - ??? bezier intersection and polygone intersections ???
  - ??? resize to standard size
  - ??? invisible elements (display:none, stroke:none and fill:none, opacity:0, fill-opacity:0 and stroke-opacity:0, stroke-width:0, ...)
  - ??? elements with wide stroke (>=1mm?)
