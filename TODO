GENERAL
=======

  - use the verbose config option and the self.message method to display user
    messages

  - artefact should be given an id that only depends on the id of the
    referenced object, so that we can "merge" artefacts to the same object
    into a single one.

  - all tagged element could receive a new description ("<desc>") for easy
    selection in inkscape (Ctrl-f)
      => it should be removed when cleaning artefacts
      => ideally, it should keep existing descriptions (prefix those messages
      with a special prefix???)

  - automatic tests => look at the way official extensions are tested using
    pytest

  - add an option "make this language the default" in expert -> config
    it should
      - remove menus
      - copy menus-LANG to menus
      - rename <name>Dynalab - LANG</name> to <name>Dynalab</name>
      - remove the "make this language the default" entry


EXTENSIONS
==========

easy
----

  - check stroke colors for allowed modes

not easy
--------

  - isolated elements
  - bezier intersection and polygone intersections ???

to discuss
----------

  - ??? resize to standard size
  - ??? invisible elements (display:none, stroke:none and fill:none, opacity:0, fill-opacity:0 and stroke-opacity:0, stroke-width:0, ...)
  - ??? elements outside page
  - ??? elements with wide stroke (>=1mm?)
