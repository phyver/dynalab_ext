some ad-hoc svg files used for running tests
(Since using the extension on those will modify them, they are listed in the
.gitignore file so that those changes are not commited, and restoring them is
as easy as running git -restore ...)


groups.svg     => several nested groups, with non trivial transforms
layers.svg     => several layers
misc.svg       => some misc. elements
100_texts.svg  => 100 text elements (complexity testing)
4096_rect.svg  => 4096 small random rectangles (complexity testing)
